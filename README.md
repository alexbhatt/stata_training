# Stata Training: Data Cleaning, Management and Manipulation

## Intro

Learn how to manipulate and clean data in Stata like nobodies business.  
For each task, youâ€™ll be provided with the key commands you'll want to use in each part.   
Importantly, the code/commands I've suggested are not the only way to solve each problem, just one way.  
Always remember to write lots of comments. Explain what and why you've done something.

## Before you start

Download the repository and unzip the folders into your project drive  
This training requires Stata v12.0 or higher

## The dataset

These data contain routine laboratory surveillance data of incident cases of bacterial bloodstream infections in England from 2015 to 2017.   
There is only one record per infection episode, however, an individual can have multiple infection episodes over time.  
This practice dataset does not contain any actual patient or laboratory data.
